# 🍎 Apple Sweetness Predictor

A machine learning-powered application that predicts the *sweetness of apples* using *image features* extracted via webcam input. This project combines *computer vision, **data preprocessing, and **regression modeling* into a seamless end-to-end workflow.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project allows users to:
- Capture an apple image using a *webcam*
- Automatically extract *color (RGB)* and *ripeness* features
- Predict a *numerical sweetness score*
- Categorize apples as *Less Sweet, **Moderately Sweet, or **Very Sweet*

## 🧠 Features

✅ Load and clean apple dataset  
✅ Normalize features with StandardScaler  
✅ Train and evaluate a linear regression model  
✅ Capture images using webcam  
✅ Extract average RGB values from the image  
✅ Predict and classify apple sweetness in real-time

## ⚙ How It Works (Simplified)

1. *Data is cleaned and normalized*  
2. *Model is trained and evaluated using RMSE*  
3. *Webcam captures an image of the apple*  
4. *Features like average RGB are extracted from the image*  
5. *Sweetness score is predicted and categorized*
