This project applies machine learning to evaluate the quality of apples based on color metrics obtained from image data. Using a dataset that captures RGB values, the model predicts key quality indicators, enabling a systematic approach to apple grading. Through computer vision and regression analysis, this method automates the assessment process, allowing for accurate and consistent quality evaluation. By focusing on visual color characteristics, the model provides an efficient tool for determining apple quality, supporting large-scale sorting and grading operations with minimal human intervention.
